Here's a detailed description of the steps carried out in your project:

1. **Loading and Preprocessing the IMDb Dataset**:
   - Initially, you loaded the IMDb dataset (`IMDB Dataset.csv`) into a Pandas DataFrame (`df`) and displayed the first 10 rows using the `head()` function.
   - You checked for any missing values in the DataFrame using `isnull().sum()`.
   - Then, you installed the NLTK library to perform natural language processing tasks.

2. **Training a Sentiment Classifier**:
   - After installing NLTK, you imported the necessary libraries and downloaded NLTK resources (tokenizers and stopwords).
   - Using the IMDb dataset, you trained a Naive Bayes classifier to classify movie reviews as positive or negative sentiments.
   - The IMDb dataset was preprocessed by tokenizing the reviews, removing stop words, and creating labeled feature sets.
   - The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and a feature extractor function was defined to convert reviews into feature sets.
   - The Naive Bayes classifier was trained using the training set, and its accuracy was evaluated using the testing set.
   - Finally, you determined the percentage of positive and negative reviews in the test set.

3. **Analyzing Flipkart Product Reviews**:
   - You loaded the Flipkart product dataset (`flipkart_product.csv`) into a DataFrame and dropped the "Price" column.
   - The modified DataFrame was saved to a new CSV file named `fp.csv`.
   - Next, you preprocessed the reviews in the Flipkart product dataset using the same preprocessing steps applied to the IMDb dataset.
   - The Naive Bayes classifier trained on the IMDb dataset was applied to the Flipkart product reviews to predict sentiments.
   - The predicted sentiments were added to the DataFrame, and the DataFrame with predicted sentiments was saved to a new CSV file named `fp_with_sentiment.csv`.
   - Additionally, you plotted a bar graph showing the average sentiment for 10 random products from the Flipkart dataset.

4. **Grouping Product Names and Sentiments**:
   - You grouped the DataFrame by both "ProductName" and "Predicted Sentiment" columns and applied the mode function to handle cases where the same product had multiple reviews with different sentiments.
   - The grouped DataFrame was saved to a new CSV file named `grouped_product_sentiment.csv`.

5. **Creating Separate CSV Files for Positive and Negative Sentiments**:
   - Finally, you filtered the grouped DataFrame to separate product names with positive and negative sentiments.
   - The product names with positive sentiments were saved to a new CSV file named `fp_pos.csv`, and those with negative sentiments were saved to `fp_neg.csv`.

6. **Displaying Results**:
   - You displayed the contents of `fp_pos.csv` and `fp_neg.csv` to verify the separation of product names based on sentiment.

This sequence of steps demonstrates how you processed the IMDb dataset to train a sentiment classifier and then applied the same classifier to analyze product reviews from Flipkart. Let me know if you need further clarification or assistance with anything else!
